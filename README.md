Why "Delete User Functionality After Authentication" is a Bad Idea

Introduction:
    In any system handling user data, it's crucial to differentiate between authentication and authorization. This distinction becomes particularly important when implementing critical features like user deletion. While authentication ensures that the user is who they claim to be, authorization determines what that authenticated user is allowed to do. Misunderstanding or overlooking this distinction can lead to severe security vulnerabilities.

Authentication vs. Authorization:
    Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It ensures that the user trying to access the system is indeed who they claim to be. For example, a user logs in using a username and password, which the system verifies against stored credentials. However, authentication alone does not grant any permissions beyond basic access to the system.

    Authorization: Authorization, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do within the system. It involves setting permissions and roles that dictate which actions a user can perform. For example, while any user might be authenticated to access their account, only users with specific roles (like an admin) might be authorized to delete other users.



Analysis of the Delete Functionality

Allowing user deletion based solely on authentication is a significant security risk. Here’s why:

    Unauthorized Access: If user deletion is permitted after just authentication, any authenticated user could potentially delete any other user. This lack of restriction could lead to malicious activity, where users delete others' accounts without proper authorization.

    Data Loss: User deletion is a critical action that could result in the permanent loss of data associated with that user account. If this action is not adequately controlled, the system could suffer from unintended or malicious data loss.

    Security Breaches: Without proper authorization checks, an attacker who gains access to an authenticated user's account could potentially delete other users, leading to a security breach. This could be particularly damaging in systems where user accounts hold sensitive information.



Best Practices

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement robust authorization mechanisms:

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implementing RBAC ensures that only users with the appropriate roles (such as administrators) have the authority to delete other users. This way, even if a user is authenticated, they won’t be able to perform sensitive actions unless they are explicitly authorized to do so.

    Granular Permissions: Define specific permissions for different actions within the system. For example, only users with the "delete_user" permission should be able to delete other users, and this permission should only be granted to roles that require it.


### Authentication vs. Authorization

- **Authentication**: The process of verifying who a user is. For example, logging in with a username and password.
- **Authorization**: The process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. For example, whether a user has permission to delete another user.
